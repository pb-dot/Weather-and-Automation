# Weather-and-Automation  

### I developed a `Weather Station` utilizing `Arduino Uno` as the central control unit. The project integrated various components such as `HCSR04` ultrasonic sensor for distance measurement, a `buzzer` for audible alerts, `DHT11` sensor for temperature and humidity monitoring, and an `LCD` display for real-time data visualization. Through meticulous design and programming, I successfully established a comprehensive system that collected and analyzed weather data, providing accurate and accessible information. This project enabled me to enhance my skills in hardware integration, sensor interfacing, data processing, and resulted in a functional Weather Station solution capable of delivering valuable insights for various applications.
